# Learning from Book _Annotated STL Sources_ by **JJHou**

27th Dec, 2017

This books examines the SGL's version of C++ STL Implementation. It showcases the advanced technique on type traits, memory management, algorithm, data structure and other STL components relationship. I have summarized some fancy stuff [here](STL-Annotation).

# Learning from Book _Effective STL_ by **Scott Meyers**

16th Dec, 2017

This book provides many useful tips when using C++ Standard Library. These tips are either for some general advice when using STL, or some detailed usage for efficiency and readbility. I have concluded the tips I have learnt [here](Effective-STL). 


# Learning from Book _Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied_ by **Andrei Alexandrescu**

11th Nov, 2017

This book introduces the policy-based design, meta-programming and compile-time technique(Typelist). With the above, the author hinges on the **black magic** of template to implement various design patterns in minimum code but maximum flexibility. I extend another existing C++11 meta-programming framework to materialize the introduced techniques. The source code is released in this repository [here](https://github.com/RUAN0007/cppackage).
